# Documentation Map

This map shows where to find each project doc.

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** process
- **Status:** active
- **Read when:** locating a project doc by topic — usage, architecture, process,
  plans, issues, or API surface.
- **Search terms:** documentation map, docs index, folder guide, where are the
  docs.

| Folder | Purpose | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `architecture/` | Durable reference for how the system works today. | You need current contracts or diagrams. |
| `api-surface/` | Package-specific upstream API manifests. | You need tracked Rust `oxipng` API snapshots. |
| `issues/` | Governed, evidence-bearing issue reports. | You file or look up a bug, regression, or investigation. |
| `plans/` | Current project plans. | You need open work. |
| `process/` | Workflow conventions and release process. | You need team workflow rules. |
| `usage/` | Downstream reference. | You need to use or integrate the package. |

This repo keeps only current docs folders. Use Git history for old plans,
specs, and reports.
